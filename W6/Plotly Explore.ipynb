        "**SENSOR MONITORING DASHBOARD WITH PLOTLY DASH:**\n",
        "\n",
        "For a sensor monitoring dashboard using Plotly Dash, real-time data visualization will be crucial. This can be achieved using `dcc.Graph` components to display live sensor data, such as temperature and humidity from a DHT22 sensor. Time-series line charts can show sensor readings over time, and scatter plots can illustrate correlations between different sensors. Interactive controls are also essential for user interaction. Radio buttons can allow switching between different sensors (like DHT22, accelerometer, and gyroscope), while a date range picker can select specific time periods for analysis. Dropdown menus can be used to choose different data aggregation methods (average, minimum, maximum, sum), and slider controls can adjust sampling rates or data filtering thresholds. To display raw data and summaries, `dash_table.DataTable` can be used with pagination. This table can also show statistical summaries (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum) for each sensor and enable data export functionality. A variety of chart types can be incorporated for different analyses: histograms for distribution, box plots for data spread and outliers, heatmaps for spatial data (if applicable), and gauge charts for real-time status. An alert system can be built using callbacks to monitor sensor thresholds, triggering alerts and color-coding charts based on predefined zones. Finally, the dashboard layout can be organized using `html.Div` and CSS for a grid structure, with tabs for different sensor types or monitoring periods. Refresh buttons can update data in real-time, and data upload functionality can be included for historical analysis. This comprehensive approach will create an interactive dashboard for monitoring multiple sensors, analyzing patterns, identifying anomalies, and customizing views."
