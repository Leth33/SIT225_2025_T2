    "SENSOR MONITORING DASHBOARD WITH PLOTLY DASH:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. REAL-TIME DATA VISUALIZATION:\n",
    "   - Use dcc.Graph components to display live sensor data from DHT22 (temperature/humidity)\n",
    "   - Create time-series line charts showing sensor readings over time\n",
    "   - Add scatter plots to show correlations between different sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "2. INTERACTIVE CONTROLS:\n",
    "   - Radio buttons to switch between different sensors (DHT22, accelerometer, gyroscope)\n",
    "   - Date range picker to select specific time periods for analysis\n",
    "   - Dropdown menus to choose different data aggregation methods (avg, min, max, sum)\n",
    "   - Slider controls to adjust sampling rates or data filtering thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DATA TABLES:\n",
    "   - Use dash_table.DataTable to display raw sensor readings with pagination\n",
    "   - Show statistical summaries (mean, std, min, max) for each sensor\n",
    "   - Enable data export functionality for further analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "4. MULTIPLE CHART TYPES:\n",
    "   - Histograms for distribution analysis of sensor values\n",
    "   - Box plots to show data spread and outliers\n",
    "   - Heatmaps for spatial data visualization (if using multiple sensor locations)\n",
    "   - Gauge charts for real-time sensor status monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ALERT SYSTEM:\n",
    "   - Use callbacks to monitor sensor thresholds and trigger alerts\n",
    "   - Color-code charts based on normal/warning/danger zones\n",
    "   - Display alert messages when sensors exceed predefined limits\n",
    "\n",
    "6. DASHBOARD LAYOUT:\n",
    "   - Organize multiple charts in a grid layout using html.Div and CSS\n",
    "   - Create tabs for different sensor types or monitoring periods\n",
    "   - Add refresh buttons to update data in real-time\n",
    "   - Include data upload functionality for historical data analysis\n",
    "\n",
