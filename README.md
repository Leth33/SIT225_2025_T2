Hi there! ðŸ«£

This is my GitHub space for **Data Capture Technologies**.  

Iâ€™m uploading my work here as I go through the unit â€” from small experiments and weekly activities to bigger assessment tasks. Itâ€™s a mix of code, data, and ideas that will keep growing over the semester. âœ¨  

Made with plenty of curiosity ðŸ’¡, a bit of trial and error ðŸ˜…, and a lot of learning ðŸ“š.  

ðŸ’– Thanks for stopping by!
