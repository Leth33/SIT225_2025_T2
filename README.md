# 🌟 SIT225_2025_T2: Data Capture Technologies 🌟

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my little corner of code and creativity for **SIT225 – Data Capture Technologies** at Deakin University 💻🧠

This repo is my digital diary where I’ll be uploading my weekly practicals, Arduino sketches, Python scripts, and everything in between. If you love blinking LEDs and talking to microcontrollers, you're in the right place!

## 📅 Stay tuned!
New folders will appear each week with more blinking, buzzing, and brilliant stuff.  
Thanks for visiting — you're amazing 🫶✨
